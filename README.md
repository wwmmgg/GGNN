Vulnerability Detection in Smart Contracts Based on Gate Graph Neural Network

Three smart contract datasets are used for our experiments: ESC (Ethereum Smart Contracts) (https://github.com/Messi-Q), SoliAudit vulnerability analyzer dataset(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17QxTGZA7xNifAV8bQ2A2dJWRRHcmPp3QgPNxwptT9Zw/edit#gid=836095968) and SmartBugs wild dataset.(https://github.com/smartbugs).
